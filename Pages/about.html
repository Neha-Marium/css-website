            <h2>CUI's History</h2>
            <h3>Historical Perspective</h3>
            <p>
                The Commission on Science and Technology for Sustainable Development in the South (COMSATS) is an international 
                organization. It aims to reduce the ever-growing gap between the developed and developing world through useful 
                applications of science and technology. The Third World Academy of Sciences (TWAS) initiated the proposal for the 
                formation of COMSATS under the leadership of Nobel Laureate, Dr. Abdus Salam.
            </p>

            <p>
                The foundation-conference of COMSATS was held at Islamabad on 4th & 5th October 1994. Representatives from thirty-six 
                countries attended. The participants included twenty-two Ministers, members of the diplomatic community of Islamabad 
                and representatives of international organizations, like UNESCO, UNIDO, UNEP and the World Bank.
            </p>

            <p>
                The conference decided that the Headquarters / Secretariat of the Commission would be based permanently at Islamabad, 
                Pakistan, and the Head of State of Pakistan would act as the first Chairperson of the forum. It was agreed that the 
                host -Government, Pakistan, would provide for the operational and administrative expenses of the Secretariat, while the 
                development programs of the Commission would be supported and financed through Technical Assistance Fund. This fund 
                would be established by contribution from member countries, income from services provided to member countries, grants 
                from international agencies and project funds, if under taken under contract.
            </p>

            <p>
                The COMSATS University Islamabad (CUI) was established in 1998, as COMSATS Institute of Information Technology (CII), 
                as a project of the Commission on Science and Technology for Sustainable Development in the South (COMSATS), which is 
                an inter-governmental organization with 27 member states in three continents; Asia, Africa and Latin America, namely 
                Bangladesh, China, Colombia, Egypt, Ghana, Iran, Jamaica, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Korea, Morocco, Nigeria, Pakistan, 
                Palestine, Philippines, Senegal, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, Tunisia, Uganda, Yemen and Zimbabwe. Then, 
                CIIT had the status of a public sector degree awarding higher education institution and was given charter by the 
                Federal Government in August 2000. Later, CIIT has been upgraded to a Federally Chartered University in April 2018 
                under the COMSATS University Islamabad Act 2018.
            </p>

            <p>
                The CUI functions under the governance of the Senate which is chaired by the Chancellor of the university. The 
                President of Islamic Republic of Pakistan is the Chancellor of the University. Besides, Islamabad it has campuses in
